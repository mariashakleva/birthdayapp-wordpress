# birthdayapp-wordpress
The Birthday App is a Wordpress Theme that lists the upcoming birthdays of registered users. It uses the default wordpress login and register functionalities. In the profile settings at the bottom, there is a custom birthday field for each user. So, each user can see the upcoming birthdays of all the people that have registered and inserted their birthday.


## Theme built with:
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

Sass is installed with gulp.js so run (if you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) )</br>

``` npm install ``` </br>

and then for editing the main.scss run</br>

``` gulp ```


## Recommendations
* Recommendation for register option: Consider using the [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) plugin or set up your server so it can implement the PHP mail() function accordingly.<br>
* Recommendation for testing and dummy data: Consider using the [FakerPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fakerpress/) plugin.


## Activate Theme
